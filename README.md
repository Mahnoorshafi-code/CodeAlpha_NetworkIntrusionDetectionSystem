# 🛡 Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) with Suricata  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a *Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)* using *Suricata*.  
It monitors network traffic in real-time, applies detection rules, and generates alerts for suspicious activity.  
As a demo, we configure Suricata to detect *ICMP Ping traffic*.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Rule-based intrusion detection  
- Real-time packet inspection  
- Custom rule for ICMP ping detection  
- Logging and alert generation  
- Works with Linux systems  

---

## 🛠 Installation  

Update and install Suricata:  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install suricata -y

⚙ Configuration

1. Edit Suricata Configuration File
```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
 
Find the rule-files section and make sure it includes:
default-rule-path: /etc/suricata/rules rule-files: - local.rules 

2. Add Custom Detection Rule

Open the local rules file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
 
Add the following rule:
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;) 

3. Test the Configuration
```bash
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

If everything is correct, you will see:
Configuration provided was successfully loaded 

▶ Running Suricata

Start Suricata on your network interface (replace eth0 with your interface, e.g., wlan0):
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0 

🧪 Generating Test Traffic

Send ICMP ping traffic to test the rule:
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 

📄 Viewing Alerts

Check alerts generated by Suricata:
cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log 

Example Output:

08/30/2025-14:21:12.345678 [] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Ping detected [] [Classification: Misc activity] [Priority: 3] {ICMP} 192.168.1.10 -> 8.8.8.8
